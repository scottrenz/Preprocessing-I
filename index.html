<div class="someblock">
												<p class="skill">  I am a self-taught computer programmer and database manager.
												I learn by reading manuals and the help systems within the software and looking
												at programs already written. I have been working on clinical trials for over 10
												years using Business Objects, Oracle PL/SQL, SQL Server T-SQL, SAS and EXCEL
												Macros with Visual Basic (VBA) to format reports and build programs.</p>
												
												
												<p class="skill">   I anticipate the needs of the team and start looking into
												manuals and help systems and programs and do Internet searches to find helpful
												programs or tips on using the software and have already figured out how to
												solve future needs and processes to take care of the needs are ready for them
												by the time the team discovers the need.</p>
												
												
												<p class="skill">  Where others use down time (or are just plain tired of their
												work) to text message or chat on the phone or look around online for fun, I
												instead am learning the next set of software tools that we will be able to put
												to use and have our work go more efficiently.</p>
												

												
												<p class="skill">  I learn things quickly and figure out the problem either on my
												own or by making inquiries to others outside to help find a solution for the situation.</p>
												
											

												<p class="skill">  Most jobs that I have had, I did not know the computer
												language or the software tools that they use before I got there, but learned in
												a matter of hours or days and was up to speed with the veterans within a couple
												of weeks and was finding better ways to use their systems and was teaching them
												new ways within a couple of months.</p>
												
												

												<p class="skill">  For repetitive tasks, I find a way to make computer programs
												to do what otherwise would need manual typing of code and commands or clicking
												on icons and selecting choices and make these tasks more efficient and less
												prone to error due to human intervention.</p>
												

												<p class="skill">  When I discover new ways of doing things, I document the
												process so that others can do the task as well if I am not around by following
												the documentation.</p>
												
												
												<p class="skill">  I will be a great asset to your team and hope that you take
												me onboard.</p>
